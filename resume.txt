First 
we learn about the c program that:
We could write coments with //like this//
/*
To write multiline comments
Look like this
*/
Import headers with (#include)
Constant : #define<keyword>
Declare function asignature first or at the top of xxx.c file
Int function ();
Must declare funtions before main()
Int main void ()
To print output usuing “printf” for print in window, if %d for integer, \n is a new line
For instant (“%d\n”, 0);
Ints are usually 4 bytes
Int x = 0;
Short are usually 2 bytes
Short x = 0;
Char are guarantees to be 1 byte
Char x = 0;
If you need to declare char literal are quoted with (' ')
Char y = ' y'
Long are often 4 to 8 bytes
Long long are guaranteed to be the last
Long x = 0;
Long long = 0;
Float are 32_bit flotating numbers
Float x = 0.0;

When we inicialize an array we must be initialized with a concrete size
Char array [20];                                      this array occupies 1 * 20 bytes
Int array [20];                                         this array occupies 4 * 20 bytes = 80 bytes
We had comparison operators
== iquals
!= inequality
<  less that
> greather that
>= greater that or iqual
<= less that or iqual
No logical
&& = and
|| = or
